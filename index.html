    <h2> A Little Bit About Me</h2>
    <p> I am Australian living in Bali working in Social Media Management and Content Marketing. After having spent the last 5 years working in agencies, I have decided to freelance full time. My passion lies with startups and local creatives, and my goal is to create affordable platforms to work alongside you, and as we bring your dream to life.
    I create and collaborate with like-minded folk to help leverage their dreams into the industry.
    Hey, I'm Annie but my friends call me Mo. I’ve been doing this for a decade – first for the big guys (like The Iconic, eBay and Matchbox) and now for smaller (but way more amazing) businesses.I am all about helping businesses who want to grow online, increasing their reach, visitors and sales. I know digital marketing can be overwhelming – so I provide the clarity, structure and accountability you need to reach your goals.Digital doesn’t have to be time-consuming or confusing. You don’t need to be on all channels, all day every day. I’ll help you focus in on the areas that can make a real difference to you and your business.</p>
